						<h3>Classical Training</h3>
						<p>Reana has classical foundations in voice and piano since the age of 4, taking formal voice lessons in multiple singing styles, concert/chamber choir, vocal ensembles, and even piano lessons centralized in classical music for several years. Reana was an active participant in professional organizations such as the Music Teachers’ Association of California (MTAC) enrolled in the Certificate of Merit (CM) program, where she was trained by Ophelia Raboca, the founder of the San Jose Academy of Music (SJAM). Throughout her activity in this program, she received level advancement CM awards for the study of piano proficiency and numerous recital awards. She also participated in the Golden State Association of Christian Schools (GSACS), where she competed in a piano competition along with a soloist performance, and where her school choir won first place in 2015 with her ensemble winning second place in 2016, California Music Educators Assocation (CMEA) as part of a women’s chorus, receiving grades marked “Excellent” in their evaluations, and Reno American Choral Directors Association (RenoACDA). Reana has also been selected to perform at the CM Branch Honors Recital and the 2015 New Materials State Convention as a result for obtaining high scores on MTAC’s CM evaluation. As of now, she still plays piano, sings traditional pieces at her church as a soloist, and is both a performer and executive board member (social media manager) of Crepusculum Choir, Berklee College of Music's student-run chamber choir.</p>

								<h3>Contemporary Training</h3>
								<p>Reana has been self-taught in music production since December 2018, when she obtained the sudden desire to make original music for her own multimedia peer project that she developed as a creative outlet during high school. As of now, she is obtaining intensive familiarity in music production for career benefits. She has proficiency in multiple DAWs, from simple applications to advanced software such as Logic Pro and Ableton Live. As an aspiring music industry professional, she also plans to obtain knowledge in Avid ProTools and FL Studio through the upcoming years. In early 2020, she started learning the guitar with the help of her father, as well as ukulele under the instruction of her mother's childhood friend. Reana is currently pursuing her contemporary music studies as a voice principal and an accepted Electronic Production and Design (EPD) major at the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Reana is attending the school with the Berklee World Tour Merit Scholarship that she received in April 2022, for receiving outstanding results on her live audition and interview session in San Francisco, California, as part of the entering student application process. She was selected to participate in the Women in STEM Pre-Orientation program before her first semester at the college. Reana is also currently an official member of notable music technology organizations, such as the Audio Engineering Society (AES) Berklee Chapter and the Women Producers Collective (WPC).</p>

								<h3>Sound Aesthetic</h3>
								<p>Taking inspiration from early 2000s pop singers with clean vocal tones and contemporary electronic music producers with the fullness of Seven Lions, fresh melodies of MitiS, and rhythmic feels of Tritonal, Reana continues to stay inspired by expert vocalists and producers. Reana uses her fondness towards a broad array of sounds to develop her experimental style, incorporating multiple sub-categories of electronic music, as well as pop, alternative, and cinematic genres. As for her production covers, Reana brings light upon the objective to transform classics into something contemporary. She enjoys creating her own versatile renditions of songs that bring upon a nostalgic sentiment or have the potential to deliver newer, modern ideas. Reana emphasizes authenticity in her melodic and progressive sound, with her dynamic powerful vocals, harmonies, rhythmic arps and basses, orchestration fullness, clear electronic drum beats, compelling sound effects and transition build-ups, along with electrifying synth leads that provide the signature energy to her music. She recently mentioned that the production of her original song, Broaden This Legacy, alluded to her sound and the style of music she prefers to be remembered for. As an explorative music artist, Reana wants to convey a melodic, electronic sound that mixes unconventional sound design aspects with upbeat rhythms.</p>

								<h3>What Led to Her Production Style?</h3>
								<p>Reana started listening to electronic music since 2014 and enjoyed it ever since. During her late middle school to early high school years, she often found entertainment in editing video game commentary videos and cinematography projects, so she would frequently download non-copyrighted electronic background music to implement them into her videos. She later developed a stronger fondness towards electronic music in 2016, after discovering the Complextro-Electro fusion song, Smoke, produced by Au5 and Fractal. This was the first time Reana really began to admire the complexity and tweaking of sounds that Electronica had to offer production-wise. She mentioned that it not only helped her develop her current music preferences, but also encouraged her to analyze music from a producer/sound designer's perspective. Since then, Reana expressed a fondness towards the creative manipulation of sound within music over the following years, and is primarily inspired by sound to create her songs. She respected the effort that successful producers put into their work so much, that she also wanted to make audible masterpieces in her own style, which she began doing in 2018. To complement her predominantly electronic sound, Reana would often implement aspects of other genres to maintain musical variety in her songs.</p>

								<h3>Leadership and Collaboration</h3>
								<p>During the apex of the Covid-19 pandemic, Reana watched a live concert clip featuring a J-Electronic Rock band called Raise a Suilen (RAS), and immediately developed a strong admiration towards their energetic music style. Taking inspiration from this band, she yearned for an opportunity to connect with other musicians as a way to disregard the hardships of the pandemic, so she came up with the idea to form a geographically-dispersed virtual band in 2021 called Luminescence. In January that year, she began reaching out to other musicians through networking sites and created digital flyers for promotion purposes. She was able to recruit four experienced musicians, and the group became a fully formed band in May 2021. Upon formation, she conducted the operation of several group activities as founder, lead vocalist, producer, composer/arranger, video editor, and brand manager. While the project was active, Reana taught herself how to write music with notation software, as well as create guitar and bass tabs for the instrumentalists. The band primarily specialized in electronic, rock, pop-rock, and alternative music. Reana formed this band to collaborate with talent and help her acquire beginner entrepreneurial experience, while also refining her craft through her creative endeavors. The project was active until May of the following year, when the group made the official decision to end all band activities, as a result of Reana's acceptance to Berklee College of Music.</p>
